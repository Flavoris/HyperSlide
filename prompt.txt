Hardening:

- Cap dt to 1/30 to avoid jump after app resumes from background.
- Use SKAction/emitters sparingly; pool obstacle nodes if possible (simple reuse list).
- On resize / safe area changes (different devices), recalc margins; keep player’s relative x (% of width).
- Guard UserDefaults reads/writes with simple try-like pattern; default safely.

Testing:
- Simulate low FPS (Xcode GPU tools) and verify: fewer particles, slightly slower spawn (adaptive). Implement a “performance governor” that reduces particle rate if average FPS < 45 for 2s.
