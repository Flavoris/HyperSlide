Add minimal SFX:

- Add SoundManager.swift to preload 3 short sounds (spawnTick.wav, whoosh.wav, thud.wav) from bundle.
- On obstacle spawn: quiet tick at most every 300ms (rate-limit).
- On near-miss: soft whoosh.
- On collision: thud.

Add a HUD mute/unmute button (top-right). Persist preference in UserDefaults. When muted, skip play calls.
