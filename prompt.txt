Add tilt controls:

- tilt: request motion permission, read CMMotionManager’s deviceMotion, map `attitude.roll` or `gravity.x` to a horizontal speed, with deadzone and clamp. Merge with drag so drag overrides while active. user can turn off in settings

Add a small “Drag or tilt to move” hint that fades after 3 seconds at run start.
