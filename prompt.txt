Add difficulty scaling:

In GameState:
- var difficulty in 0...1 computed from elapsed seconds. Example: d = min(1.0, elapsed/90.0).

In GameScene:
- Derive parameters from difficulty:
  - spawnInterval = lerp(1.0 ... 0.3, by d)
  - obstacleSpeedY = lerp(240 ... 700 px/sec, by d)
  - add occasional “narrow fast” vs “wide slow” variants by probability weighted on d
- Update “Level” derived from difficulty (1...10). Expose to HUDView.

Ensure dt-based motion:
- Use `update(_ currentTime:)` with stored `lastTime`. Move obstacles by `speedY * dt`.
