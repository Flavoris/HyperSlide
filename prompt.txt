Update README.md to document the new multiplayer features and behaviors.

Constraints:
- Keep the README concise but informative for new contributors and players.
- Follow the existing style and structure of README.md as much as possible.

Requirements:
1. Add a new "Multiplayer" section that covers:
   - That the game supports Game Center multiplayer with a shared arena (all players see the same obstacles and power-ups).
   - How to start a multiplayer match from within the app (which menu/button).
   - The rule that the **match ends when only one player is left alive, but the winner is the player with the highest final score**, not necessarily the last survivor.
2. Document power-up behavior in multiplayer vs single-player:
   - Slow-motion power-ups:
     - In single-player: affect only the local player’s run as currently implemented.
     - In multiplayer: when any player collects slow-motion:
       - That player (the **collector**) keeps normal movement speed.
       - All **other players** are slowed for the effect duration, making it harder for them.
     - Stacking rules: slow-motion can stack in multiplayer (extending duration and/or effect) but is capped to keep gameplay fair.
   - Other power-ups:
     - Note that in multiplayer, power-ups are allowed to spawn even while others are active and can stack, but there is a global cap to prevent excessive stacking.
     - Clarify that **only one player can collect a specific power-up instance** (“first touch wins”), and the power-up disappears for everyone else immediately after collection.
3. Briefly describe Game Center dependencies:
   - Mention that Game Center must be enabled on the device and that the Game Center configuration (leaderboard id, etc.) must match the identifiers used in GameCenterManager.
4. If present, update any "Features" or "Roadmap" sections to reflect that multiplayer and friends-only high scores are now implemented features rather than planned ones.
5. Ensure the README remains accurate with respect to:
   - Single-player behavior.
   - Multiplayer behavior and edge cases (e.g., what happens if Game Center is unavailable).
