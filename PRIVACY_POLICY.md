# Privacy Policy — HyprGlide

Effective date: 2025-12-13

HyprGlide is an iOS game built with SwiftUI and SpriteKit. This Privacy Policy explains what information is processed when you use the game.

## Summary

- HyprGlide does not include advertising, analytics, or tracking SDKs.
- The game stores gameplay settings and best scores locally on your device.
- If you use Game Center features (multiplayer, leaderboards), Apple’s Game Center services process your Game Center account information and related network data.

## Information We Process

### Game Center (optional)

If you sign in to Game Center and use multiplayer or leaderboards, the game may access and display:

- Your Game Center display name
- Your Game Center player identifier (GameKit `gamePlayerID`)
- Leaderboard scores/ranks (including friends-only leaderboards, if you choose to view them)

In real-time multiplayer, your display name and in-game state (such as position and score) are shared with other players in the match through Apple’s Game Center real-time networking.

### Motion & Fitness (optional)

HyprGlide offers a tilt control mode that uses your device’s motion sensors (for example, gravity/device motion) to control the player. Motion data is used in real time on your device and is not stored or sent to us.

You can disable tilt controls in the in-game Settings and use touch controls instead.

### Local device storage

HyprGlide stores certain information on your device using `UserDefaults`, such as:

- Control preferences (tilt enabled, sensitivity)
- Difficulty and visual/audio preferences
- Tutorial completion state
- Best scores (stored locally; and optionally submitted to Game Center if you’re signed in)

This information stays on your device unless you delete the app (or reset the app’s data).

## Information We Do Not Collect

HyprGlide does not:

- Collect or store your name, email address, phone number, or precise location
- Access your photos, contacts, microphone, camera, or calendars
- Use third-party advertising networks
- Use third-party analytics or tracking (including IDFA)

## Sharing

- **Apple Game Center:** If you use Game Center features, relevant information is processed by Apple as part of Game Center and is subject to Apple’s policies. See Apple’s Privacy Policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

We do not sell your information.

## Data Retention

- Local settings and best scores are retained on your device until you delete the app or reset its data.
- Game Center data (such as leaderboard scores and multiplayer connectivity) is retained according to Apple’s Game Center policies.

## Your Choices

- Play single-player without signing in to Game Center.
- Enable/disable tilt controls in Settings and manage Motion & Fitness permission in iOS Settings.
- Sign out of Game Center in iOS Settings to stop using Game Center features.
- Delete the app to remove locally stored settings and scores.

## Children’s Privacy

HyprGlide does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version and update the effective date.
